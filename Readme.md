## Frontend: Vue.js

1. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Build assets**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    For production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Notes
- Ensure both servers are running for full functionality.
- Update API endpoints in Vue.js to match Laravel backend if needed.
- For integrated projects, Laravel Mix may handle Vue.js compilation.
